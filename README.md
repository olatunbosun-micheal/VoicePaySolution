# VoicePay — Inclusive Financial Assistant

**VoicePay** is a multilingual, voice-enabled assistant that helps underserved users complete everyday money tasks simply and safely.

### Purpose

* Reduce barriers from language, literacy, and trust.
* Support everyday actions: transfers, airtime/data, bill pay, and micro-savings.

### Key Features

* Multilingual UX & voice: English, Nigerian Pidgin, Yorùbá, Hausa, Igbo, Swahili.
* Low-literacy flows: clear steps, previews, confirmations, and safety prompts.
* Prototype tasks with demo data; real integrations pluggable later.

### Users & Scenarios

* Market traders, rural farmers, artisans, students.
* Quick airtime, bill confirmations, savings nudges, balance previews.

### UX Principles

* Speak the user’s chosen language (UI + voice).
* One action per screen; show totals/fees; confirm before sending.
* Accessibility: large targets, high contrast, optional “slow mode” and repeat.

### Architecture (High Level)

* Web app (Next.js/React) for UI, language choice, and voice playback.
* Lightweight API routes for preferences and demo transactions.
* Future adapters: bank/telco/payments and optional LLM/TTS services.

### Roadmap

* Phase 1: Multilingual UI/voice, airtime/bills/savings demos.
* Phase 2: Cloud TTS/LLM with strict privacy controls.
* Phase 3: Image-to-bill, offline/USSD handoffs, agent support.

### Success Metrics

* Task completion and time-to-complete across languages.
* Comprehension/confidence pulse checks and drop-off reduction.
* Repeat usage and partner integration readiness.
